# MMM-MPlayer
This is a module for [MagicMirrorÂ²](https://github.com/MagicMirrorOrg/MagicMirror) that uses MPlayer to display various video files and RTSP streams.

## Work In Progress
This module is currently being modified.<br>
The main branch contains the original code.<br>
The dev branch contains the new code.

## Project Status
This module is working, but some positioning related issues exist.<br>
See the [known bugs](#known-bugs) section for details.

PIR functions have not been tested by me, as I do not use it.

## Installation of mplayer
### Verify if mplayer is already installed
```shell
$ which mplayer
/usr/bin/mplayer
```
### Install mplayer (when not installed yet)
```shell
$ sudo apt install -y mplayer
```

## Installation of the MM module
1. In your terminal, change to your MagicMirror module directory `cd ~/MagicMirror/modules`

2. Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/evroom/MMM-MPlayer`

3. Make changes to your `config.js` file.

	  ]
	}
},
```
## Configuration Options 
###
| Option | Description | Default |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| `layout`  | Can be '', 'row' or 'column'.<br>If not set to row or column, an explicit `windowPosition` entry is expected in the `windows` object | "" |
| `monitorAspect`  | Set the aspect ratio of your monitor or TV screen.<br>Examples:<br>16:9 or 1.7777<br>4:3 or 1.3333<br> | 0 |
| `noAspect`  | Disable automatic movie aspect ratio compensation. | false |
| `noBorder`  | Disable playing movie with window border and decorations. | false |
| `rotate`  | Rotate window.<br>-1: Do not rotate (default).<br>0: Rotate by 90 degrees clockwise and flip.<br>1: Rotate by 90 degrees clockwise.<br>2: Rotate by 90 degrees counterclockwise.<br>3: Rotate by 90 degrees counterclockwise and flip. | -1 |
| `windowPosition`  | Position of the first window (window-0).<br>[window-1 is either 5px below or to the right of this window, depending on layout].<br>OPTIONAL  as it can be set in the `windows` object. | { x: 5, y: 225 } |
| `windowSize`  | Window size for the windows.<br>OPTIONAL as it can be set in the `windows` object. | { width: 640, height: 360 } |
| `windowWidthNoNewAspect`  | Scale image to width <x> - Disables aspect calculations. | '' |
| `windowHeightNoNewAspect`  | Scale image to height <y> - Disables aspect calculations. | '' |
| `windowWidth`  | Set width to value and calculate height to keep correct aspect ratio. | '' |
| `rtspStreamOverTcp`  | Used with 'rtsp://' URLs to specify that the resulting incoming RTP and RTCP packets be streamed over TCP. | false |
| `rtspStreamOverHttp`  | Used with 'http://' URLs to specify that the resulting incoming RTP and RTCP packets be streamed over HTTP. | false |
| `preferIpv4`  | Use IPv4 on network connections. Falls back on IPv6 automatically. | false |
| `ipv4onlyProxy`  | Skip the proxy for IPv6 addresses. It will still be used for IPv4 connections. | false |
| `videoOutputDriver`  | Specify a priority list of video output drivers to be used.<br>Use 'mplayer -vo help' for more info. | false |
| `noSound`  | Do not play/encode sound. | false |
| `mplayerOption`  | Use additional mplayer option .<br>See 'man mplayer' for the possible options.<br>This option is to experiment with the mplayer options.<br>Example: "-flip". | "" |
| `streamInterval`  | Cycles the streams defined in `windows` after the provided interval (in milliseconds).<br>Where applicable, the streams will start from the beginning again (for example for mp4 videos). | 30000 |
| `windows`  | Array of window objects with individual configuration |  |
| &emsp; `windowSize`  | Window size.<br>OPTIONAL but required when `layout` is not 'row' or 'column' | { width: 640, height: 360 } |
| &emsp; `windowPosition`  | Position of the window.<br>OPTIONAL but required when `layout` is not 'row' or 'column' | { x: 5, y: 225 } |
| &emsp; `streams`  | URL of the stream(s) [ mp4 , rtsp ] | 'http://stream1.example.com/video1' |

### Streams for testing
These public streams can be used for testing:
- http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4
- http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/ElephantsDream.mp4
- http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/VolkswagenGTIReview.mp4

## Test environment
This procedure has been tested on:

- Raspberry Pi 4 Model B Rev 1.5 with 8 GB RAM
- Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm)
- MagicMirror version: 2.30.0

## Support for MMM-pages
[Still under development]<br>
This module has support for the module MMM-pages:
https://github.com/sdetweil/MMM-pages

It will start and stop the video stream based on the notifications:
- NEW_PAGE
- PAGE_CHANGED
- SHOW_HIDDEN_PAGE
- LEAVE_HIDDEN_PAGE

If payload == 0 then START_STREAM_CYCLE else STOP_STREAM_CYCLE.
Requirement for the moment, is that MMM-MPlayer needs to have page index 0, so it needs to be the first page in the config.

## Known issues
- When streaming a network camera using RTSP, it has been reported that the stream may lag or even freeze. It is not clear yet if this is a limitation of the Raspberry Pi or that the RTSP stream is causing this.

## Known bugs
- When using 1 stream in 1 window, the positioning is not always correct. Restart of MM may be necessary.
- When using 2 streams in 1 window, the positioning is not correct when cycling through the streams.
- When using 2 streams in 2 windows, the positioning is not correct when cycling through the streams.

All 3 issues seem to be more related to mplayer then to the module.

## Opening Issues
Opening an Issue is possible, but I cannot promise to be able to do something about it.<br>
The code for the module was inherited and many stuff heavily depends on the MPlayer code (the latest MPlayer release is 1.5, created on 2022-02-27).

When opening an issue, be sure to include you config, a good description of the issue and [MMM-MPlayer] entries you might find in the log(s).

It is always recommended to try one of the public streams for testing, to see if streaming is possible at all.

## Data gathering
Raspberry Pi (Debian) based, but might apply for other platforms as well.
```shell
$ grep version ~/MagicMirror/package.json
$ cat /proc/device-tree/model; echo
$ lsb_release -a
$ uname -a
$ free -h -t
```
```shell
$ ps -eaf | grep mplayer | grep -v grep
```
```shell
$ pm2 flush
$ pm2 restart MagicMirror
$ sleep 20
$ grep 'MMM-MPlayer' ~/.pm2/logs/MagicMirror-*.log
```
